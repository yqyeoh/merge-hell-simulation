An algorithm is like finding a name in a phonebook. Algorithms are a step-by-step approach where there is exactly one correct next step. An easier way to think about this is the strategy that you would take to find one specific name in a phonebook.

Changing bad code is part of the process. I used to think that every piece of code I wrote needed to be perfect. But making improvements to your code is normal. You’re not writing a book that can’t be changed once it’s published.

You’re going to wake up in the morning thinking about code. And when it happens, it’s really freakin’ cool.

It’s ok to admit what you don’t know. When you land your first programming job, you might be inclined to “fake it till you make it.” Don’t. Nobody expects you to know everything right away.
