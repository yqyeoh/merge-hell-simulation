An algorithm is like finding a name in a phonebook. Algorithms are a step-by-step approach where there is exactly one correct next step. An easier way to think about this is the strategy that you would take to find one specific name in a phonebook.

Learning to code isn’t easy. But that’s why it’s worth doing.

Pair program as much as possible. There is no faster way to learn how to code.
