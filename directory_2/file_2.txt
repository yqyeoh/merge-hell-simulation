Letting problems pile up without checking is a poor strategy. I used to make endless changes to my code and expect it to work right away. The problem with this approach is that it stacks one problem on top of another, and it becomes difficult to figure what went wrong.


Learning by yourself is really tough. Talking about code and collaborating with other aspiring developers is a better way to learn for most people.
