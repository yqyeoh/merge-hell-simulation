You learn by doing. The only way to get better at programming is to actually program. Don’t let an analysis paralysis prevent you from ever starting.


Programming isn’t like studying for a test. Memorizing stuff doesn’t matter all that much.


Cheating is completely acceptable. I use Google to solve most of my problems, and so do most programmers.
